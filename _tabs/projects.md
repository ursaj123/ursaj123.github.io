## Selected Projects

<details class="project">
<summary><strong>Research Ecosystem</strong> <em>(Dec 2025 – Present)</em></summary>

<div markdown="1">

**Tags:** Research Automation, Agentic AI, LLMs, Systems

**Links:** [Code](https://github.com/ursaj123/research-ecosystem)

- Motivation: struggled to find structured research mentorship and wanted a system that enforces  
  **paper reading → theory → code → evaluation**.
- Building an **agent-driven research mentor** that assigns papers, coding tasks, ablations, and theoretical questions, then evaluates submissions and provides feedback.
- Designed workflows to convert **paper understanding, code, and answers** into semi-automated technical blogs with minimal manual editing.
- Exploring a **research network layer** where reading behavior builds a research profile and suggests relevant authors for collaboration or outreach.
- Actively under development and evolving with advances in agentic and generative AI.

<summary><strong>Extension of ADMM for Multi-Objective Optimization</strong> <em>(Jan 2025 – Jul 2025)</em></summary>

<div markdown="1">

**Tags:** Optimization, Convex Analysis, Algorithms

**Links:** [Code](https://github.com/ursaj123/Multi-Objective-Optimization)

- Thesis project focused on extending **ADMM** to structured **multi-objective convex optimization** problems.
- Conducted an extensive survey of multi-objective formulations and accelerated single-objective methods.
- Implemented and evaluated ADMM-style updates for  
  `min f(x) + g(z)  s.t.  Ax + Bz = c`,  
  analyzing Pareto fronts across identity and rectangular constraint setups.
- Observed strong performance in smooth settings, with limitations in ℓ₁-regularized cases reflected by low hypervolume and coinciding solutions.

<summary><strong>SuperUNet Reproduction and Ablation Study</strong> <em>(Jan 2024)</em></summary>

<div markdown="1">

**Tags:** Deep Learning, Medical Imaging, Reproducibility

**Links:** [Code](https://github.com/ursaj123/SuperUNET)

- Implemented the **SuperUNet** paper entirely from scratch as a coursework take-home assignment.
- Reproduced core results and conducted multiple **ablation studies** to analyze architectural and training choices.
- Focused on understanding *why* components worked, not just reproducing metrics.
- Strengthened hands-on experience in translating research papers into clean, working code.

<summary><strong>OlympicAnalysis</strong></summary>

<div markdown="1">

**Tags:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, Streamlit

**Links:** [Code](https://github.com/ursaj123/Olympic-Analysis)

- Performed end-to-end **exploratory data analysis** on Olympic datasets.
- Built an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for country-wise and sport-wise performance.
- Emphasized interpretability and storytelling over complex modeling.
- Published as a lightweight, user-facing analytics application.
