Hi there! I am Ayush Jangid, an IDD student at IIT BHU studying Mathematics and Computing, an aspiring ML Engineer looking forward to contribute back to the community from where I got to learn a lot.

My interests lie in Optimzation Theory, Explainable-AI and Theoretical Deep Learning. I am also quite fascinated by Computational Biology and Reinforcement Learning and am looking forward to explore them in the near future.

Moreover, I am an upcoming Data Scientist at [OLA CABS](https://www.olacabs.com/). Previously, I have done internships at [INFOEDGE](https://www.infoedge.in/) (building recommender system for better job recommendations), [CLUCLOUD](https://clucloud.com/) (fraud detection and dashboarding), [LCS2 lab](https://www.lcs2.in/) (research intern on reducing latency for code-mixed translation and zero-shot classification for low-resource languages), [VAL lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) (distractor-aware few shot learning) and am currently doing my theis with [Prof. Debdas Ghosh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/mat/people/debdasmat) of IIT BHU (Extending Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to its Multi-Objective Variant). 


I am looking forward to write extensive blogs on Mathematics and AI, and share the best resources and knowledge known to me.
