Hi there, I am Ayush Jangid, a Machine Learning Researcher. In this blog, I will share my insights on how to become a Machine Learning Researcher. I will also share a roadmap that you can follow to become a Machine Learning Researcher. So, let's get started.

## Introduction

When I started my college, I had an interest in Mathematics and thus started learning it from online courses like **```Convex Optimization by Stephen Boyd```, ```Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang```** and then later I started out with Python and Machine Learning from **```Andrew NG```**'s basic Coursera courses.

Even after understanding mathematics first, it was not of much help to me in understanding ML comcepts as I couldn't relate them together, because the depth I studied earlier wasn't required much initially in ML. But during my final years in collge, when I started to study more and more papers, I used to feel great connection between the two and thus used to give me a great intuition.

So, I would be trying to provide you a roadmap in order to study efficiently and at the same time in great depth, and a great amout of breadth also, which would be quite helpful in interviews.

I am planning to provide the roadmap first along with the resources, then I'm thinking of writing the implementation (in python mostly) and theoritical blogs on that (mathematics behind the blogs sometimes).

I feel it would be quite long of a journey, so, on that note, let's startðŸ˜Œ

## Roadmap
I'll be mentioning all of the best resources known to me, you can skip on if you understand them very well already.


### 1. Python
- The subsequent blogs assume that you are familiar with python and its data structures, if not start with this notebook python.ipynb and practice some DSA (150 basic) from neetcode.io. This should cover your DSA and python aspect very well (from interview perspectives also).
- Maybe you can give some contests to practice, maybe on leetcode.com, codeforces.com, etc, but that's isn't much needed, still it's totally worth the time spent.
- If you are new to coding, it could take some time, but it'll be of worth anyways, and try it to finish within 3-4 months to understand it truly.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib are at the heart of Data Science. There are many great resources to learn them, but I believe the best way to learn them is practice and doing a hands on project.
- So, first of all get friendly to them by doing a basic course on kaggle.com, these are very short courses, 
- To my knowledge, campusx's olympic data analysis is the best EDA video out there, I coded along with the video, check it out here.
- I guess this shouldn't take more than a week or 10 days.

### 2. Classical Machine Learning
The problem with ML is that it has great breadth and depth as well, so one can get completely overwhelmed, so I think it's necessary to know when to go in depth, and what's actually your target. Many job interviews require breadth and sound understanding of the projects mentioned, and some of them even require in-depth understanding. My suggestion would be to cover the breadth first.

### 4. Computer Vision
### 5. NLP
### 6. GenAI (GAN, Transformers, Stable Diffusion)
### 7. Linear Algebra
### 8. Optimization
### 9. Probability and Statistics
### 10. Computational Mathematics
### 11. Theoritical ML and DL
As it can get math heavy sometimes
### 12. Paper reading sessions
- I am also thinking of starting off a paper reading discussion group, feel free to join and learn along, this way I'll also be informed of the new technology.
- Below are some of the survey papers I read during my thesis and the college

### 13. Computational Biology 
- will see how this fares out
I am thinking off to learn GNN and RL also, thus I would be updating this blog.

My interests lie in Optimzation Theory, Explainable-AI and Computational Genomics

My inbox is always open. Whether you have a question or just want to say hi, Iâ€™ll try my best to get back to youðŸ˜‰!" -->

<!-- I am a Mathematics and Computing student at IIT BHU with a passion for Machine Learning and its mathematical foundations, mainly in Optimization theory. 
      
      I have done courses like Linear Algebra, Convex Optimization, Topology and Functional Analysis which deeply support my curiousity in Explainable AI and Deep Learning foundations. I also have an interest in Computational Biology (mainly genomics). I am an upcoming Data Scientist at [OLA](https://www.olacabs.com/) in Bangalore, India.

      I will be trying to write hands-on blogs on both Computational Mathematics and Machine Learning alongwith their mathematical foundations. -->
